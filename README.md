# OpenKruise Dashboard 2.0 Documentation

## Introduction

### Overview
The OpenKruise Dashboard 2.0 is a sophisticated web-based interface designed to manage game server deployments across Kubernetes clusters. This dashboard serves as a comprehensive management tool, providing users with the ability to monitor, configure, and control various aspects of game server infrastructure, tailored specifically for game deployment scenarios.

### Purpose
The purpose of the OpenKruise Dashboard 2.0 is to simplify the deployment and management of game servers on Kubernetes clusters, offering a visual and intuitive interface for performing complex operations. The dashboard integrates advanced features that cater to the specific needs of game server management, such as hot updates, server isolation, and automated scaling.

For a detailed overview, refer to [OpenKruise Introduction](https://openkruise.io/kruisegame/introduction/).

## Core Concepts

### DeployUnit
- **Definition**: A DeployUnit represents a Kubernetes cluster or a group of clusters where game servers are deployed. Each DeployUnit is a managed environment where GameServerSets and GameServers are created and maintained.
- **Features**:
  - **Cluster Management**: View and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters designated as DeployUnits.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Monitor and allocate resources like CPU and memory to ensure optimal performance of game servers within each DeployUnit.
  - **Deployment Control**: Manage the lifecycle of game server deployments within each DeployUnit.

### Project
- **Definition**: A Project in the OKG Dashboard is a logical grouping of GameServerSets, representing a complete game or a specific part of a game that needs isolated management.
- **Features**:
  - **Organized Management**: Group GameServerSets and GameServers logically to manage them as part of a single game project.
  - **Isolation**: Projects provide isolation for different parts of a game or different games altogether, allowing focused management.
  - **Resource Monitoring**: Track resource usage across all GameServerSets within a project, ensuring balanced and efficient use.

### GameServerSet
- **Definition**: A GameServerSet is a collection of game servers that share the same configuration and are deployed as a unit. It defines the desired number of replicas, update strategies, and specific configurations for game servers.
- **Features**:
  - **Replica Management**: Define and adjust the number of game server replicas to meet the demand.
  - **Rolling Updates**: Apply rolling updates to GameServers with minimal disruption, supporting strategies like in-place updates.
  - **Template Configuration**: Set up a template for GameServers, including container images, resource limits, and other settings.

### GameServer
- **Definition**: A GameServer is an individual server instance within a GameServerSet, representing a single instance of the game running on a Kubernetes pod.
- **Features**:
  - **Instance Control**: Start, stop, and restart individual GameServers as needed.
  - **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health and status of each GameServer to ensure optimal performance.
  - **Dynamic Configuration**: Modify settings and configurations of individual GameServers on the fly, adapting to changing conditions.

For information on deploying game servers, refer to [Deploying GameServers](https://openkruise.io/kruisegame/user-manuals/deploy-gameservers).

## Dashboard Overview

### Global Configuration Page
- **Purpose**: The Global Configuration page allows users to set up and manage the global settings that affect the entire OKG Dashboard. This includes defining project labels, configuring DeployUnits, and setting global policies.
- **Features**:
  - **Project Label Key**: Define the label key used to identify which project a GameServerSet and Gameserver belongs to. This is crucial for organizing GameServerSets and GameServers across DeployUnits.
    - **Note**: Ensure that the project label key defined here matches the label key used when deploying GameServerSets. The project name in the GameServerSet YAML file should align with the configuration in the Global Configuration to ensure proper organization and functionality.
      
    **Example YAML for GameServerSet**:
    
      ```yaml
        apiVersion: game.kruise.io/v1alpha1
        kind: GameServerSet
        metadata:
          labels:
            # The GameServerSets that have this label can be recognized by the Dashboard.
            project-name: project-new
          name: game-new
          namespace: default
        spec:
          replicas: 5
          updateStrategy:
            rollingUpdate:
              podUpdatePolicy: InPlaceIfPossible
          gameServerTemplate:
            reclaimPolicy: Delete
            metadata:
              labels:
                # The GameServers that have this label can be recognized by the Dashboard.
                project-name: project-new
            spec:
              containers:
                - image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/acs/minecraft-demo:1.12.2
                  name: minecraft
